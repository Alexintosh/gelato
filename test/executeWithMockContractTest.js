    // 1. Test scenario using Mock contract of the Execute() func

    TEST SCENARIO
    - User wants to sell 10 WETH for RDN on the DutchX twice, with an interval span of 6 hours. The execution time of the first tx is now.
    - The DutchX has a WETH-RDN auction currently running, with:
        - Auction Index 10
        - Auction Start time: now - 6 hours => Auction is running and started roughly 6h ago
        - Current price: 1WETH == 100 RND => Num === 100 && Den === 1
        - Current Fee: 0.2% => Num === 1 && Den === 500
    #1 The 1st execution should pass without a problem. Gelatos balance should be deducted by the sell amount. The claim should be burned.
    #2 Executing the second claim right after that should result in the execution time reverting
    #3 Skip ahead in time so we and test if we are at the right block
    #4 Change the DutchXMockContract values and test if they were correctly incremented
    #5 Test if the second claim can be successfully executed. The Gelato balance should be deducted by the sell amount. The users balance should be updated by the withdraw amount. The claim should be burned
    #6 Repeat #3 && Ã¤4
    #7 Execute third tx and check if the user balance was successfully incremented

    // // 2 / 3. List the order of calls we conduct within the execute function to the DutchX

    1. dutchExchange.getAuctionIndex(buyToken, sellToken) => 10
    2. dutchExchange.getAuctionStart(sellToken, buyToken) => now - 6 hours
    3. dutchExchange.getFeeRatio(address(this)) => num: 1, den: 500 => 1 / 500 == 0,002. 10 WETH / 500 => 0,02 WETH === Fee
    4. dutchExchange.depositAndSell(_sellToken, _buyToken, _sellAmount) => true
    5. dutchExchange.closingPrices(_sellToken, _buyToken, _lastAuctionIndex) => num: 1000 amount RDN, den: 10 amount WETH => 10WETH should => 1000 RND WETH/RDN === 100RDN
    6. dutchExchange.claimAndWithdraw(_sellToken, _buyToken, address(this), _lastAuctionIndex,withdrawAmount) => true
